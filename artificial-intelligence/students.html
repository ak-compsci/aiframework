                            <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> is technology that performs tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, and decision making. These systems are built by combining disciplines like mathematics, statistics, and computer science. They are used in many everyday applications like digital assistants, recommendation engines, and self-driving cars.</p>

                            <h3>Key Concepts and Applications</h3>
                            <p>AI systems are designed to reason on input and explain on output, offering human-like interactions and decision support for specific tasks</p>

                            <h3>Examples in Action</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Voice assistants:</strong> When you say "Hey Siri" or "Okay Google," you are interacting with AI.</li>
                                <li><strong>Recommendation engines:</strong> These systems suggest content, like movies or products, based on your past behavior.</li>
                                <li><strong>Customer service:</strong> Chatbots and virtual assistants that provide customer support are a form of AI</li>
                                <li><strong>Image and speech recognition:</strong> The technology that allows phones to recognize your face or understand your voice is AI-driven.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>How AI Works</h3>
                            <p>AI systems learn from large amounts of data using techniques like machine learning and deep learning. They identify patterns and make predictions or decisions based on that data.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Machine Learning (ML):</strong> A method where AI systems learn from data to improve their performance on specific tasks without being explicitly programmed.</li>
                                <li><strong>Deep Learning:</strong> A subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers to analyze complex data like images and speech.</li>
                                <li><strong>Generative AI (GenAI):</strong> A type of AI that can generate or create new things, like text, images, or even music, based on the instructions you give it.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Types of AI</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Narrow AI:</strong> AI systems designed for specific tasks, like voice recognition or recommendation engines.</li>
                                <li><strong>General AI:</strong> A theoretical form of AI that can perform any intellectual task a human can do. This type of AI does not yet exist.</li>

                            <h4>Why Foundational Skills Matter:</h4>
                            <p>Think about using a language translator app to communicate in another country without learning any of the language yourself. If the app makes a mistake or stops working, you can't tell what's wrong or fix it because you don't understand the basics of that language.</p>
                            
                            <p>The same thing happens with AI. If you always let AI write your essays, you won't develop your own thinking and writing skills. If AI solves all your math problems, you won't understand the concepts you need for more advanced work.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Essential Skills to Develop BEFORE Using AI:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Reading Comprehension:</strong> You need to understand what you're reading to know if AI's answer makes sense</li>
                                <li><strong>Writing Skills:</strong> Even if AI helps you brainstorm, YOU need to organize and express your own thoughts clearly</li>
                                <li><strong>Math Fundamentals:</strong> Understanding basic operations, fractions, and problem-solving strategies</li>
                                <li><strong>Critical Thinking:</strong> The ability to analyze information and spot when something doesn't make sense</li>
                                <li><strong>Research Skills:</strong> Knowing how to find and verify information from reliable sources</li>
                                <li><strong>Creativity & Self-Expression:</strong> AI can't draw from your personal experiences, memories, or cultural background.</li>
                                <li><strong>Human Connection & Relationships:</strong> AI can't actually care about you or understand your feelings. The relationships you build with family, teachers, and classmates are what make learning meaningful.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h4>The Right Way to Think About AI:</h4>
                            <p>Think of AI like training wheels on a bike, not like a motorcycle. Training wheels help you learn to balance while you're still developing the skill. But the goal is to eventually ride without them! AI should help you learn and practice skills, not replace the need to learn them.</p>

                                <p><strong>Remember:</strong> AI gets smarter when YOU get smarter. The better you understand the subject, the better questions you can ask and the better you can judge if AI's answers are correct.</p>

                            <h4>👎 Bad Prompt:</h4>
                            <p>"Tell me about the American Revolution."</p>
                            <p><em>(This is too vague. You'll get a long, boring text that's probably too complicated.)</em></p>
                        
                            <h4>👍 Good Prompt (using PREP):</h4>
                            <p>"Act as a history teacher <strong>(Role)</strong>. Write a short summary of the *main causes* of the American
                                Revolution <strong>(Prompt)</strong>. Focus on 'taxation without representation' <strong>(Explicit
                                    Info)</strong>. Explain it in three simple paragraphs, like you're talking to a middle school student
                                <strong>(Parameters)</strong>."
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Note:</strong> This example works well because you already understand the American Revolution from your
                                history class. That background knowledge helps you ask better questions and recognize if the AI's answer is accurate!</p>

                            <h4>👎 Bad Prompt (This is cheating!):</h4>
                            <p>"Write a 500-word essay about the causes of World War I for my history class. Include an introduction, three body
                                paragraphs, and a conclusion."</p>
                            <p><em>(This is asking AI to do your homework FOR you. You won't learn anything, and it's plagiarism!)</em></p>
                        
                            <h4>👍 Good Prompt (This helps you learn!):</h4>
                            <p>"Act as a study tutor <strong>(Role)</strong>. Help me understand the main causes of World War I by breaking them
                                down into simple categories <strong>(Prompt)</strong>. I know about alliances and the assassination of Archduke
                                Franz Ferdinand, but I'm confused about how imperialism and nationalism played a role <strong>(Explicit
                                    Info)</strong>. Explain each cause in 2-3 sentences and give me one specific example for each
                                <strong>(Parameters)</strong>."
                            </p>
                        
                            <h4>Why the Good Prompt Works Better:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>You stay in control:</strong> You're asking for help understanding, not asking AI to do the work
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>You learn the material:</strong> Now you can write YOUR essay using your new understanding</li>
                                <li><strong>It's not cheating:</strong> You're using AI like a tutor, not a ghostwriter</li>
                                <li><strong>You can ask follow-up questions:</strong> "Can you give me another example of nationalism?" or "How
                                    did these causes connect to each other?"</li>
                            </ul>
                        
                            <p><strong>Note:</strong> The goal is to become smarter, not to avoid learning. Use AI to understand concepts better, then write your own essay. Be sure to verify the information generated and cite your sources!</p>
